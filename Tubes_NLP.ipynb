they were solidly investment grade for some  time   i don   t think you can fault these companies for doing  business with a company that represented 20 percent     of the  market    some companies

how well the  energy industry has responded with enron   s problems       he said        the past month the energy players have stepped up and taken over  positions that enron had   and the energy market today is working  very well        felsinger said   15 million in business with enron isn   t      material     and will not affect sempra energy   s earnings this  year or next year

chairman of a committee investigating  possible price manipulation in the state   s wholesale power market    comments on how an enron corp   bankruptcy would affect the probe        if we assume enron files for bankruptcy   either through  liquidation or reorganization   our ability to deal with the  corporate entity to get documents and access to witnesses will be  overseen by a bankruptcy court   which means we have to jump  through additional hoops and ladders to get the information we may  require        substantively   it doesn   t affect our investigation at all  because the senate   s investigation is not out to get anybody   we  are tying to get a very thorough understanding of why we got into  the mess we are in and whether any concrete legislative fixes in  the wholesale market need to be taken        enron was a critical player in setting up the market that  ultimately gave rise to the market power   which in my view is the  ultimate cause of the energy crisis        there are some pluses and there are some minuses if we  assume that enron disappeared from the energy trading market   it  would create a void that would have to be filled by other players  in the wholesale market        if those other players that fill that void do not currently  posses market power   that   s a good thing because the diffusion of  market share   most economists will tell you   is one of the best  ways to eliminate already existing market power        if enron goes into reorganization bankruptcy rather than  liquidation   and they are purchased by one of the big players that  currently possesses market power   then we are only going to  complicate the crisis that we currently find ourselves in        cibc says it is owed   215 million by cash   strapped trader enron

energy trader   s common and convertible  preferred stock at the end of 2000 and restricted employees    ability to sell    as of the end of 2000   about   1   8 trillion was invested in  401   k   plans serving 42 million u   s   workers   according to cerulli  associates   investors in 401   k   plans lost money last year for the  first time since they were introduced in 1981 as stocks fell        maybe some good will come of     enron   s collapse in the way  of national pension reform   said bernstein       it   s never   ever  prudent to put your company stock in your retirement plan   the  overwhelming majority of plans allow it and a large plurality of  them encourage it   a fairly significant minority of plans have  very large amounts of company stock   you want to diversify your  risks   if your company fails   at least you have a backstop        bernstein said individual investors ought to consider putting  their retirement savings into a combination of low   cost mutual  funds that track indexes for u   s   stocks and bonds and  international stocks       the average person has as much business  managing their own retirement as they do taking out their own  appendix       said bernstein   a neurologist by profession    in addition   average 401   k   plan expenses of 3   5 percent of  assets exceed the projected annual returns of 3 percent from  stocks in coming years after adjusting for inflation   meaning  investors are facing zero long   term real gains   bernstein said    expenses are lower with traditional corporate pension plans    known as defined benefit plans because they guarantee a certain  level of retirement benefits based on pay and years of service        the way defined contribution plans are currently set up  there is not adequate controls on expenses   what you   re really  getting is an enormous transfer of wealth from plan participants  to the financial services industry   this is an enormous social  experiment that   s been foisted upon us and it   s going to be a  failure       said bernstein    enron corp   has fourth   busiest day for a u   s   stock   table  2001   11   29 17   17   new york    enron corp   has

negotiating a recovery plan with creditors   a  provision of u   s   bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt    collection efforts   lawsuits and other actions against the  company        a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash   starved  company being attacked from all sides       said nancy rapoport   dean  of the university of houston law center    thousands affected  an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people    including the company   s 21   000 employees   its customers    suppliers   investors and other creditors   the court   supervised  recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies  and fix mistakes   it might take years to complete and may end in  the company   s liquidation    in addition to its energy trading operation   enron operates a  nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25   000 miles   it also owns  portland general electric   which generates and distributes power  to about 725   000 customers in the pacific

leases        every bad business deal enron got into they   ll walk away  from       said peter chapman   a distressed   debt investor who also  publishes newsletters on high   profile bankruptcy reorganizations    recovery  the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a  company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy   a plan  typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing  two   thirds of a company   s debts   then a company would ask a  bankruptcy judge for final approval    the recovery plan divides a company   s value among various  classes of creditors   under a hierarchy set by the u   s   bankruptcy  code   secured creditors     those with collateral backing their  claims     are paid ahead of unsecured creditors   such as  bondholders and suppliers    financial advisers to creditors and companies in large  bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be  particularly difficult to produce        you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass  of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches   brew of a  bankruptcy       said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard    zukin   an investment banking firm that has been contacted for  advice by enron bondholders    shareholders  enron   s shareholders are likely to lose all of their  investment in chapter 11 because they would be last in line to get  paid    some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may  come from lawsuits   said russell a   belinsky   an investment banker  with chanin capital partners   which also has been approached for  advice by enron bondholders        there   s a lot of juicy legal issues       said belinsky    potential targets include enron   s accounting firm and its officers  and directors       disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization  is going to be a painstaking job        liability  dynegy might face some liability for cancelling its purchase  of enron   dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave  it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the  takeover fell apart   dynegy received the right to the pipeline in  exchange for a   1   5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco  corp     which owns one   fourth of dynegy    enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking  away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline    the dynegy acquisition   valued at   23 billion when it was  proposed on nov   9   collapsed as bankers failed to raise the   1   5  billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed   the  lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy   s  decision    bankers led by j   p   morgan chase   co   vice chairman james b    lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed   investors  turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn   t be  able to pay its debts    unraveling  enron   s unraveling began in october after it said  shareholders   equity was reduced by   1   2 billion because of the  way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created   the  announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u   s    securities and exchange commission   and enron ended up restating  earnings for almost five years    as shares plunged   enron   s trading partners lost confidence  the company would have the cash to pay bills   trading partners  such as mirant corp   either demanded more collateral to trade or  restricted trading with the company        the situation is dire       said deltec   s hindes       no one   s  going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up  being an unsecured creditor tomorrow      ',\n",

gas characteristics will behave at various conditions   for the purpose of this analysis   the following is considered 1   agave red bluff on   line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc   2   gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p   1 and p 2 3   pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6   14   9   00 am flowing conditions are listed below  the following graph   attached in ms word   is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis   by mapping the above relative pressure   temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist    the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced   that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p   2 and cs p   3   furthermore   using the process model used to generate the phase envelope   the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases   using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls   per day that could

do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times   the   owens   corning   delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we don   t get a handle on liquids   i have ask eric faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out    i have talked with   agave   the producer about this and we   re working together to try and figure out what   s going on   we can pick up water on our instruments but there   s not anything that we know of that will show condensate   this has to be carrying through in the gas because there   s not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point   the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often   after getting the liquid in at p   3 we ran a pig from roswell to p   1 and it came in dry   as soon as the volumes come up we   ll run from p   1 to p   2 then into p   3   thanks for everyone   s help in this   if we need a conference call to discuss let me know    it had been about six weeks between pig runs this time   total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time   the time before this run we received about six thousand barrels    thanks  rj  randy lebeau  06   12   2001 04   46 pm  to   gary spraggins   et   s   enron   enron  cc   rich jolly   et   s   enron   enron  subject   pigging from p   2 to p   3  gary   we recently had to run a pig from p   2 to p   3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line   we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line   apparently   in order to run a pig   some volume has to be routed to that line   i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this   but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it    the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas   this point feeds some domestic customers   we don   t want condensate getting into this point    there is a customer on this line   owens   corning   who gets fuel from us   their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes   at any given time   i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production   if they lose fuel   the product is lost and we could be liable   i am also told that once the plant goes down   it could take a long time   even weeks   to get it back up    the owens   corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel   when the line has large amounts of condensate   we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point   this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure   the gas from energas is not measured   they used to have the contract   but when we got it   they removed their meter setting   apparently they agreed   verbally   to supply gas to the plant in march   for a few hours   when a pig was run   the plant uses about 3 mmcf   d and energas was on for about 3 hours   i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel             21   000   obviously we will negotiate that amount   but they have us at a disadvantage   i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours    everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule   we would not get large condensate amounts into p   3   which shuts us down   by the way     we would not have to use energas   we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point   and we would not incur the overtime when this happens    i   m sure rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region    we would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then   depending on what we push into p   3   get on a regular schedule       possibly once a month    what do you think we can do to work something out    thanks for any help you can give us                                                forwarded by eric

bankruptcy looms by lisa sanders   cbs   marketwatch   com newswatch more headlines houston   cbs   mw       dynegy corp   on wednesday abandoned its plan to rescue enron corp   after enron   s credit ratings were cut to junk   bond status   raising the prospects of a bankruptcy filing for what was once the largest u   s   energy trader   enron shares   ene   closed at 61 cents   down   3   50   having lost as much as 85 percent of their value on the day and having collapsed from a 52   week high of almost   85 just 11 months ago   the company lost around   2   6 billion worth of market capitalization from tuesday to wednesday   close to 342 million enron shares had changed hands wednesday by the close   and the stock broke the all   time volume record of 309 million shares set by intel on sept   22   2000   dynegy   dyn   shares lost   4   92   or 12 percent   to   35   97   saying in a conference call that it had to   protect   its shareholders   dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with enron   citing   enron   s breaches of representations   warranties   covenants and agreements in the merger agreement   including the material adverse change provision     company   specific problems   dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said     some of the best deals are the ones that don   t get done       while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties   this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business     he said   dynegy president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom said that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for enron   s diminished role in the business and that the industry has suffered   no degradation     as he put it     there has been a clear flight to quality   and it   s occurring as we speak     bergstrom said     dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform     dynegydirect is a platform much like enron   s flagship enrononline   which it turned off wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online energy   trading platform   accounting for an average of   3 billion in trades a day   dynegy   s trading exposure to enron is   75 million   and the company is no longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow houston industrial giant   bergstrom said     dynegy   s customer   based   asset   backed energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us with earnings sustainability and future growth     watson said   as part of the deal   dynegy had the option to keep northern natural gas   enron   s highly valued natural   gas pipeline   even if the agreement were terminated   the company said during the call that it would exercise that option   chevrontexaco   cvx     which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy   originally gave   1   5 billion to the company in the transaction   dynegy used the money to purchase 100 percent of the preferred shares of northern natural gas   enron has 180 days from the date the merger agreement was signed   nov   9   to repurchase the pipeline system   watson said   enron said in a statement that it was reviewing dynegy   s claim of rights to northern   enron representatives did not participate in the call   and dynegy executives said they had been advised against the customary practice of taking questions   enron said it has temporarily suspended payments   other than those necessary to maintain   its core energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those operations alive     to do this   we will work to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses     said enron chairman and ceo ken lay   enron told employees their questions would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks on friday   analysts said the next step for enron would likely be a bankruptcy filing     chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means     said john olson   a houston   based energy analyst     the key to salvaging the business is the level of debtor   in   possession financing they can get to allow them to trade in some realistic fashion     dip financing takes precedence over all other claims   he said     the equity people are now at the very bottom of the barrel   and the only people lower than them are   the people who filed   the stockholder suits     olson said   in a note to clients   analyst michael heim of a   g   edwards said that enron   without dynegy   has   no value       enron       will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly     heim said     unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price   there are no hard assets to salvage     ahead of this news   s   p cut enron   s rating to b   minus   or junk status   from bbb   minus   which is the lowest investment   grade rating   the rating agency said that the move reflects   concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction   the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications     moody   s made its announcement of a rating cut to b 2 from baa 3 and said that enron   s debt remains under review for additional downgrade   in its report   moody   s cited the likelihood of a dynegy   enron breakup   fueled by enron   s declining financial performance   as the reason for the downgrade     moody   s       baa 3 rating was predicated on good prospects for completion of the merger with dynegy and reasonable prospects for marginally investment   grade characteristics of the merged entity     moody   s wrote     furthermore   lack of confidence in enron by its trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting enron   s core trading operations     for enron to survive   the credit agency said   it   s imperative that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable   fitch   which had rated enron bbb   minus   lowered the rating to cc   which   indicates that default of some kind appears probable     the u   s   treasury is keeping an eye on the impact the enron fallout is having on the credit markets   spokeswoman michele davis said wednesday     we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day     davis said     markets always fluctuate and we haven   t seen anything extraordinary     treasury said that outside its surveillance of credit markets   it would refer any inquiries on energy trading to the federal energy regulatory commission or the commodity futures trading commission   earlier in the day   image   dynegy   which had originally offered to buy enron for   9 billion in stock   confirmed tuesday that the two companies were discussing a new deal structure   and it said ahead of the credit   ratings and eventual termination news wednesday that discussions were continuing     i   m not aware of any changes in any status of the merger     dynegy spokesman john sousa said before the s   p announcement   the merger agreement contained a material adverse   affect clause that   if triggered   allowed dynegy to walk away from the deal   the decline in enron   s stock price and information contained in the company   s 10   q filing of nov   19 could had activated the clause   but olson said the s   p downgrade clearly fit the description of a material adverse affect   also wednesday   ubs warburg and rbc capital cut their ratings on enron   to   hold   from   strong buy   and from   strong buy   to   buy   speculative     respectively   lisa sanders is a dallas   based reporter for cbs   marketwatch   com     image      image

working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use   it is also working on  correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly   london trades  many more swaptions and asian options than the us   therefore   the impact of  not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them    the majority of options in the u   s   are european monthly and daily exercises  and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals   the  idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the us   but other  more material items always got in the way and we

status update on the issues surrounding continental power  volatilities and correlations  as you know for some time we have been trying to get the continental power  traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option  portfolio and for use in calculating their var as it has been obvious that  the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in  their mark    in looking at the impacts of this   various other issues came to light    firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the var model as  this was way out of date   we have worked with jitendra and have now put in a  matrix that both the traders   risk and rac are happy with   secondly   as you  may be aware   in portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the  deal ticket and not off any volatility curve    the current portfolio is 90   swaptions and so this represents a serious issue  for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at  the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change   we cannot  use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise  options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options   we also have not found any  way in portcalc of valuing asian options so we are having to   force   in the  few we have   we have had the houston based portcalc it team work on a   new    piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of  worrying bugs   these are primarily that the proposed code does not take the  correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of   approximating    the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  underlying    they are currently being hampered in that they do not have any it personnel  who have sufficient option knowledge   i understand that the two most  experienced coders resigned to go to another houston based energy company      this is extremely worrying and i find it hard to believe that the whole of  enron   s power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the  volatility at the deal ticket level   this will almost certainly mean that  different volatilities are being used in the var as are being used to value  the swaption portfolio globally   as well as these issues we have concerns  over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in portcalc   worryingly it  does not seem that you can   switch   this off     briefly it seems that portcalc  calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike  price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the  forward price of the underlying itself    we have engaged london based it and are looking at the code we have used in  power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start  to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book asian options    once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or  gamma risk from portcalc in it   s current state as the information is just no  there   so we are told by it     the system   seems     we cannot be 100   sure  given all the other errors   to produce a vega and gamma p   l number but what  the risk is remains a mystery   again this is very worrying in that we have  power option traders all over the world who can   t get their underlying vega  or gamma risk position from the global valuation system   we are trying to  work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but i would really like  to know how the american based traders cope as they have this problem    knowingly or not   for years   what sign offs were gained for the  implementation of enpower because it seems to us that using the current  system it is not possible to comply with the global risk policy   how do we  validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk    despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher  volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their  var   however   as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily  remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their   model     vol  curve generator   i have today asked for a full explanation   details of any  testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle      the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the  impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility    i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing  the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been  covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help   we are having  to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and  are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies  of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of   consequently we have  not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in  gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but i would hope you agree that  it is not for a lack of trying    sorry it   s so long but if there are any questions or any perceived  inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know    james',\n",

 2001 12   32 pm est  enron   ene   nyse   news   commentary   research   analysis   shares plunged a second straight day wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader   s bailout merger plan will unravel    a potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping enron   even though its planned acquirer dynegy   dyn   nyse   news   commentary   research   analysis   has injected   1   5 billion of cash   and banks have opened new credit lines   an enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders   and it would cause big losses for the houston company   s creditors    just before noon est   enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid   december a   690 million obligation that was due next week   it also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining   450 million of a previously announced   1 billion secured credit line that has j   p   morgan chase as its lead banker    investors have been fleeing enron since the company last month disclosed a   1   2 billion writedown to unwind some related   party hedging transactions   the securities and exchange commission is probing enron deals with related parties   the october disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn   t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances   and it showed that enron was facing serious liquidity problems    those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy   but enron   s disclosure monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits   in the wednesday release   enron ceo ken lay said his company was still committed to the merger     we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders   employees and lenders     dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is   continuing our confirmatory due diligence   regarding the merger   neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment    after plunging 23   tuesday to   6   99   enron was down a staggering 34   at one point wednesday   it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at   4   90   enron shares have lost more than 80   of their value since the company issued its third   quarter earnings release last month   dynegy dropped   2   44   to   39   26   though it remains substantially above premerger levels    at the heart of enron   s trouble is the sense that the company isn   t letting on the full extent of its troubles   the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct   16   when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a   1   2 billion writedown to unwind some related   party transactions   critics of the company said those deals   in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers   raised serious ethical and disclosure issues    the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron   since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron   s situation   as a result   shares in both companies rallied after the deal   s announcement   but monday   s disclosure that enron faced   690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed   according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday   dynegy wasn   t aware of the   690 million obligation   critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations    liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as   5 billion of cash in recent weeks   by the end of 2002   enron has to find around   9 billion to pay back various obligations   it had   1   2 billion in cash on hand as of nov   16   according to the filing    tellingly   dynegy shares haven   t plunged along with enron   suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for enron but not for dynegy   at current levels   enron shares are trading at more than a 50   discount to the dynegy offer    j   p   morgan has taken a leading role in helping enron   it has lent funds and it helped restructure the   690 million obligation   the bank   s stock was down 78 cents to   38   62     we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron   s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy     said james lee   a top banker at morgan   in the enron release    from cbs   marketwatch   com   online at    dynegy   enron say merger to proceed  by myra p   saefong  1   52 pm et nov 21   2001  washington   cbs   mw       merger partners enron and dynegy restated their  commitment wednesday to completing a deal   on the heels of embattled  enron   s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay  off a   690 million note set to come due next week      we are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to  accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger      said chuck watson   dynegy   s chairman and chief executive   in a  statement    shares of enron   ene   recovered slightly in afternoon trading but  remained under pressure    on heavy volume   the stock     which had touched   4 earlier in the  session     was down   1   83 to trade at   5   16   a new 10   year low   some 84  million shares had changed hands    enron declined 23 percent tuesday after the company revealed the  upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings    meanwhile   dynegy shares lost   1   83 to stand at   39   87    enron said that the lead bank on the   690 million debt agreed to extend  the maturity date to mid   december   which will give the company time to  restructure the facility   and added it expects to further restructure  its debt      we       believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to  enhance our cash position   strengthen our balance sheet   and address  upcoming maturities     said jeff mcmahon   chief financial officer   in a  statement    j   p   morgan chase co   said it and other lenders are committed to  helping enron improve its financial position    also   enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with dynegy and said  it closed on a previously announced   450 million line of credit from  j   p   morgan   collateralized by the company   s northern natural gas co    enron     which is being acquired by its smaller rival dynegy   dyn   at a  fire   sale price     revealed in a securities and exchange commission  filing monday that it had to pay off or refinance   690 million in debt  obligations by next monday or risk triggering nearly   4 billion in  additional payments    if enron had missed that deadline and didn   t post collateral   investors  had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of  enron   s limited partnerships   the unusual business entities at the  center of the company   s murky transactions currently under  investigation    the sec filing of monday also contained yet another restatement of  financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more  than four years of restated earnings figures    earlier wednesday   goldman sachs lowered its rating on enron   s stock to    market performer   from its   u   s   recommended list     citing   major    liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the  business it has lost    cibc world markets also cut enron to a   hold   from a   buy      commerzbank weighed in wednesday   saying enron   s viability is in doubt      we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious  financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt      analysts andre meade and andrew smith wrote     it appears that enron   s  situation could worsen in a number of ways      though enron   s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal  situation   meade and smith characterized the information as   piecemeal        it appears that the full extent of enron   s problems is not currently  known     they said in a note   cautioning clients against investing in  enron  ',\n",

jones   company   inc      in the wake of last month   s terrorist attacks   natural   gas prices have slid below   2 per million british thermal units   frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural   gas projects    analysts predict that with prices at current levels   projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u   s   could be shelved or canceled    natural   gas prices   which reached highs of nearly   10 per million btus last december   had held to around   3 to   5 per million btus for much of the year   at   2 per million btus and below   producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production    analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand   fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric   utility demand   nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to   2   208 on the new york mercantile exchange    in the boston area   however   different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region   last week   the u   s   coast guard   under pressure from local lawmakers   indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor   lng makes up 15   of new england   s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days   the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists    already   relative to other areas   natural   gas prices have inched higher in new england   where natural   gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market   the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to   1   30 per million btus   said a spokeswoman for distrigas   a unit of belgium   s tractebel sa   but the lack of lng isn   t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural   gas storage is used up    richard grant   ceo of distrigas   says lng has a 30   year safety record at the company   s everett   mass     terminal   while lng is flammable   he says it is unlikely to explode   he adds that   there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual   but until we answer the concerns   we won   t be able to bring a ship in here      deutsche banc alex   brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth   quarter projections for natural   gas prices last week     prior to sept   11   we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back     said jay saunders   a deutsche banc analyst     but all that is out the window now     deutsche banc is now estimating a 20   drop in winter demand in the industrial sector   which accounts for more than a quarter of total u   s   natural   gas consumption   the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage   which is on pace to be full by the end of october    while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers   such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural   gas demand is met   lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms   such as eog resources inc     plan to moderate production in the next two months   gas drilling   rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1   030 at the end of august    even with the increased natural   gas drilling of earlier this year   overall natural   gas supply is expected to increase just 1   this year   as the country   s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them   the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates   increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence    still   the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form   with prices high last winter   el paso corp   and enron corp     among others   said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas   which is gas compressed and frozen to minus   260 degrees fahrenheit     you will see some cancellations and some delays     predicts marshall adkins   an analyst with raymond james   associates in houston    natural   gas prices need to average   3 per million btus on the east coast and   3   50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas   said ronald barone   an analyst with ubs warburg    a spokeswoman for el paso   houston   says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u   s   market   enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004    copyright   2000 dow jones   company   inc   all rights reserved    enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank  freny patel mumbai  10   02   2001  business standard  5  copyright   c   business standard  after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra   kurla complex   enron has been able lease out 10   000 square feet of it to citibank na    against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors   enron will get around rs 1   2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank    the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant   cushman   wakefield   at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot    with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the  short run   companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets    property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors   it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer   as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income    enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12   000 per square foot    this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8   000 to rs 9   000 per square feet   in june 2000   the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125   75 crore when it acquired the four floors   plus car park space   from wockhardt   the pharmaceutical company    the deal was struck at rs 10   500 per sq ft   and included parking space for 101 cars    industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property   and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired    in order for it to break even   it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13   000 per square foot    four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises   a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property      most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase     he added    moreover   the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built   up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises   and enron   s proposition continues to go abegging   said the consultant    copyright   2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers  though hewlett   packard lost   65 billion in market value in a year   ceo carly fiorina hasn   t lost her

of women who came to power slowly   says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in   patient but not passive     the story that accompanies the list     by patience   we mean staying with a company

fortune   s inaugural list in 1998   heads the biggest company     48 billion in revenues last year   run by a woman   and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever   wall street practically heckled her latest move   a bold bet to buy compaq   but fiorina   47   remains defiant   in difficult times     people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny     she says    as always   the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time   last year   power resided in the technology and internet sectors   but that influence was fleeting   gone from the list this year   deborah

a source of cheap   stable energy   alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller   since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect    it should be noted that bc   s premier   gordon campbell   has had long   standing poor relations with alcan   inc   of canada   a competitor of alcoa   s   while in the opposition   campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a   1   3 b hydroelectric power project   earlier this year   bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy   back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border   if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with   he will likely do so   to that end   look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it    alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements   in a recent shareholder meeting last week   alcoa   s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks   the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out   and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re   establishing revenue growth    kaiser aluminum  with the hiring of harvey perry as the company   s new aluminum chief   kaiser   s long   term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear   as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa   they are still in discussions   if anything new arises   we will keep you updated    bc hydro  bc government  campbell   s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration   some of the communities in northern british columbia   such as fort   st   john   dawson creek   black gold and fort mcmurray   have had significant recent population booms   and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region   currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia   significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers   which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska    bc hydro  hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers   due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power   bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market   avoiding its traditional subsidy of the   jobs for power   program   and pursuing lucrative cross   border contracts with us firms   at the same time   hydro will be moving to slice community programs   anywhere from   6 to   8 million   and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the   20     25 million range   bc hydro   whose annual revenues hover typically around   300 million   is looking at early mini   budget estimates for 2001 to be in the   375 million range   its trading subsidiary   powerex   has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california   and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court    bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board   which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell   from campbell   s transition team   we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate   although we believe he is a vice   president at west coast energy   the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks   so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november   in the meantime   campbell and gary collins   the finance minister   will be calling the shots on hydro   s future   keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines   neufeld   has the official title   but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier   the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda    bonneville power administration  financial solvency  after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen   patty murray   s   d   wa   office   it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional   2 billion in borrowing authority   over the   3   75 billion of existing authority it already has   may be scuttled   sen   murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review   the white house   the senate appropriations committee   omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill   the feeling is that if the   2 billion of additional authority would be issued   the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare    eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half   the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september   when there is another energy bill conference   obviously   now that bush   s energy bill has passed the house   they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation   we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling    spill issues  the   5 million spill over two columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups    fish managers   notably critfc   s bob heinith and odfw   s christine mallette   had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none   but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year   power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill   citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water   making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams   and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike   minnow    dam breaching  congressman jim mcdermott   d   wa   recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower snake dams   it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of engineers to   partially remove   the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa   clean water act or tribal treaty obligations      the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal     mcdermott said in a july 19 press release     if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously   and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams   then no one would be happier than i would     he said     now is the time to plan for all contingencies      co   sponsored by tom petri   r   wi   and 19 other representatives     but no others from the northwest     the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee   where opposition has massed quickly   led by butch otter   r   id   and doc hastings   r   wa     the two issued   dear colleague   letters asking fellow members not to support mcdermott   s bill    pacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching   the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically   now that energy prices have come down again   they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation   although they are much weakened now    forestry issues  forest fires  one of the largest

remedial measures   virtually stripping the cal   px and cal   iso of their  control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate  bilateral forward contracts    the commission   s main action   effective with the issuance of the order after  the friday afternoon meeting   removes the requirement that california  utilities buy and sell exclusively through the california power exchange    cal   px   and clears the way for bi   lateral contracts in the forward market    ferc scheduled a settlement conference for dec   19 in washington of parties  in the state   s power market to negotiate those contracts      california does   not   have the benefit of a competitive market     chairman  james hoecker said   noting he had heard the state   s power market called

risk   he urged the california  public utilities commission to   step up to its responsibilities   in  supporting the ferc   directed activities    massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the   apocalypse    in california   is absolutely staggering   the two largest utilities are  virtually bankrupt     he predicted a court   acting on accepted law and  precedent   would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the  costs from customers   spreading the costs out over the entire state    pg   e corp   officials lambasted the commission   s actions   saying

disappointed  by the insufficiency of today   s ferc order     pg   e officials said in a  statement     the remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to  provide a solution that

april 12   reuters     the teflon around energy and trading powerhouse  enron corp   is starting to show some scratches   as negative events over the  past few months from india to its broadband unit   begin to take their toll    analysts say    make no mistake   wall street still sees the houston   based giant as the energy  convergence sector leader   analysts polled by thomson financial   first call  still believe enron will meet its earnings per share targets of   1   75 for 2001    but the stock has dropped to its lowest levels since late 1999   a slide which  started with news that enron   s keystone broadband content deal with  blockbuster inc   had fallen apart    the stock had traded in the mid     80 s as recently as february   before the stock  market   s recent collapse and a string of negative news   on friday   it traded  at   57   45 on the new york stock exchange   down   1   06 cents or 1   8 percent   and  well off its high of   90   56 last august      their share price hasn   t been bulletproof and that   s what counts   they were  up pushing   90 and they   re now in the   50 s while the energy sector has done  quite well   so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesn   t seem  bulletproof to me     analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said    meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of enron   s  valuation   particularly in devaluing the broadband business      with broadband the market initially gave them full credit   but investors got  smart over the next year   and once you got some bad news out there   you could  argue that valuation was pulled     meade said    but the bad news neither starts nor ends there    the latest negative item came wednesday   when a california federal judge  ordered enron to return the university of california and california state  university systems to direct power access   which enron says will cost them   12  million a month    the universities   lawsuit which claimed enron energy services breached their  power management contract   could cast a shadow over the houston   based  company   s power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in  business involving similar multimillion dollar deals with large corporations    other bad news includes broadband layoff talk   failed water company spinoff  azurix inc     s impending sell   off its north american assets   the failure of the  video on demand deal with blockbuster   word that the   2 billion sale of  utility portland general is unlikely to go through and continuing payment  problems at the dabhol power plant in india    that long   running dispute in india reared its head again on monday   enron  confirmed it issued a notice of political force majeure to the maharashstra  state electricity board   mseb     which has consistently defaulted on payments    force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could  not have been prevented      it   s one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights   it   s one step    but it   s not the only step     enron spokesman john ambler said    enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the indian national  government   but it has refused to cover mseb   s   21   9 million december bill  until enron and mseb settle another dispute over a fine   the mseb wants the    85   8 million fine   which it levied   to cover its outstanding bills    layoffs or redeployments    another nettling problem for enron is news of trouble at enron broadband  services   ebs     the cutting   edge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth  trading operation and a broadband content services business    most recently   enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the  number of employees at ebs because of the stock market   s faltering confidence  in telecoms generally    two weeks ago   the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit  as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were  growing at a higher rate      it   s word games   initially they said they were redeploying   and that was not  the word i heard from inside the company   but that was the way they put it    it   s probably a little of both     said analyst john olson of houston investment  house sanders morris harris    ebs spokeswoman kelly kimberly on monday said 227 employees were leaving the  broadband unit to work in other areas of the company      most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already  moved into corporate or another business     kimberly said    kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a  severance package   but characterized it as a small percentage    it has been a rough few

to   mack   iris  cc   lin   martin  subject   re   possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston  university  hi iris  i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron   one is as a  financial economist   the other as the director of the newly formed   global  mobility innovation initiative   gmii       this is the research project  funded by lucent   involving bu   lbs   and insead   to study various aspects  of the mobile internet   read 3 g      on the former i am working with a couple of ph   d   students in understanding    a   details of how having physical supply   inventory   can be used by a  market maker   this is a problem that has been studies in the context of  specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in  the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth   i  think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the  ground      b   how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market   this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss     having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another   all of the incomplete contracting    asymmetric information   and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models   but they are real in practice   my impression is enron   s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining      c   how enron manages the various books that involve physicals   financials    credit etc   this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore   include non   linear risk profiles   the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years    on the gmii front   i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber   i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue   i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room    i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues   perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call   clearly   having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me    as for schedules   the first 3 weeks of april are horrible   april 26   27    may 3   4 are good for me    regards  nalin  at 06   56 pm 03   22   2001   mack   iris wrote      hi         as we briefly discussed   i spoke with one of my colleagues   dr      martin lin   about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some    time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications   real options      etc         martin and i are working on various broadband related problems         we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about    the following        when you want

to level 2 processes   the  initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the    blueprint     a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and  recommended systems   a complete   roadmap   should be laid out with a  0   3 months   4   6 months   7   9 months and 10   12 months timeline   the plan  addresses tactical also    our overall objective   build an infrastructure   people   processes and  systems   that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim   the  current industries are forest products and steel   however   additional  industries may be added   the targeted infrastructure would require little  change to support new industries    the delieverable is expected by the end of 2   01   we   d be happy to visit with  you all   video

as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality  between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals    in particular i promised info on a few areas    project q assessment  a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals    being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem   however high level issues  which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were    q is over specified for metals   traffic   logistics for metals is less  complex than oil   coal    metals process tends towards buy   store   sell whereas for liquids the storage  is not as prevelant  metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship   barge  2   inventory controls  again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals   paul  wallace a manager in the co   ordination function is working extensively on  developing the controls in this area   i would suggest that you contact paul  directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in  general    3   funding of inventory  we have a structured finance facility here in london   the deal is specific to  enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are  the base index for all the positions placed in the facility   if structured  financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either  david tregar   metals commercial   or bill appleby   global finance   as an intro  to the issues faced    4   curve management process  the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme  curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and  location   given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by  brand group and port location   e   g   for copper this means we have a grid with  5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups   13 for europe   7 for the us and 6  for the far east     the maintaince   price testing of the grids is made  manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port  groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points  i   e   price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a  market quote    5   re recruitment of paper traders  i haven   t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david  rosenblum   one of the metals traders in chicago   is a trader of recylced  paper    i   ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london    i   d appreciate same for eim

state will try to save the  utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities   hydro assets in  exchange for rate increases    wednesday   state receives bids from auction   rate ranges are expected to be  between 5   5 and 8   0 cents per kilowatt hour    mid week   audit findings will be released   audit expected to show pg   e   s  utility subsidiary handed over   5 b to the holding company   the holding  company used   4   4 b to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock    state commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible  bankruptcy scenario   bankruptcy still very possible for both  companies    davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue  solutions or   bail out      legislation  there will be continued discussion regarding bill ablx in the senate today    the discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5   5 cents per kilowatt hour as  well as the term   assemblyman keeley   the author   indicated that he believed  5   5 cents was   a fantasy   and impossible to obtain    today   assembly speaker bob hertzberg   d   sherman oaks and assemblyman fred  keeley   d   boulder creek will introduce legislation whereby the state  would temporary or permanently take both pg   e and edision   s hydroelectric  facilities or transmission lines   or both   in exchange for keeping the  utilities out of  bankruptcy   the state would allow pg   e and edison to impose rate increases    however   the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this  month by the cpuc as an emergency surcharge   the money collected from  consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state  would then enter into long   term contracts with power generators   under the  bill   the state of california would control 10   of all california   s  electricity   as you  can imagine   this legislation has not received unanimous praise   according  to recent corporate filings   pg   e   s hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between   3 and   5 billion   this amount just happens to be what davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the   12 billion in debt    davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about   4 billion in debt   while the utilities   of course   say the full    12 billion should  be covered    on wednesday   state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come   davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5   5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling   though few  agree with his opinion   a handful of smaller   independent electricity  providers with about a 30   share of california power market   indicated sunday  night they would come down to   less than eight cents   or less than half of  what they currently charge   in return for the stability of long term  contracts   because  consumers pay about 6   5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  puc rules   any hope california has to   work off   the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to davis   price cap   without falling back on  higher prices for consumers   the level of bids will be particularly  important since bond  rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on  friday   worried that there was no obvious long   term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state    utility   s audit  by the middle of this week   california auditors will release their findings  about how much money pg   e and socal edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure   this will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee   if they guarantee any of the debt   the truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years   a  source with  knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years   pg   e   s utility subsidiary handed over about   5 billion to the  holding  company   of that total   the holding company used   4   4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock    another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators   at the time of deregulation   under the  direction of  former r   gov   pete wilson     forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power   generating plants   auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants   electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour   compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january    bankruptcy  the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities   senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy   as all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week   they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy   but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage   under such conditions   the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and  triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy   is still quite high    california   s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy   the state or the two  utilities    the short answer was that no one has any idea   below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge    1   would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy    some of the advisors thought that pg   e and edison   s finances were so  bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option    advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation   this would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos    2   could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of  electricity to consumers   the legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought   particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies   and  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge    3   if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that pg   e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity    he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages    4   if the utilities go into bankruptcy   the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges   the state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier    one of the reasons why suppliers won   t sell electricity on credit to these  companies now      5   if the two companies went bankrupt   it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history   straining just about everyone involved in the process    6   the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the ferc for pg   e and already in place for edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think   this is particularly true if this week   s audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments    davis  opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his  job   and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits   one of davis  concern   s is   according to a senior official in the governor   s office   that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti   utility and  anti   business that it cripples future growth in the state   according to a  senior official     no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system   but he did   with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion   the threat of direct   popular action  is at least as large now as then     consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate   payer bills   this official goes on to say      the  anger at utility companies is so high here   that almost anything rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldn   t do anything about it     this threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders     floating a bond issue or a  guarantee

sent   thursday   october 18   2001 6   19 pm  thursday morning session         meeting with state commissioners  this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process   although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend   upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame   it was a long morning   i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts    approximately 35 to 40   of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts   most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support   everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc   primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process   that ferc was moving too quickly   and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens   in particular   the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric   while many would think that the session was extremely negative   our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting     in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing     allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis    here   s some individual comments    catherine riley   maryland       she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens   she was way overboard in the dramatics department     she then stated that she was not at the meeting to   help you   ferc   backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record     it went on like this for about 15 minutes   the good part is that she was so personally negative   that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her    sam ervin   north carolina       he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens   that customer choice is never coming to his state   so he will never benefit from an rto   that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto   and i bet if they do   he   ll work to change the statutes     and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc   his comments were also pretty brutal   but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor    arnetta mcrae   delware       she kept on saying   show me   where the benefits for consumers are   she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order    rory mcminn   new mexico       repeatedly talked about how the west was different   how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers   how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were    carl wood   california     tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole   and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments   he delivered the same messages that we   ve been hearing forever       ferc should have acted sooner on price caps   etc etc    glen thomas   pennsylvania       he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it   s energy system into the new century       that by opening it   s markets they have had an explosion in green power   they have reduced costs all across the state   etc   he was very supportive of pjm   makes sense because it   s in his back yard   and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance    judy jones   ohio       was very parochial in her discussion   but echoed don svanda   s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed    ed garvey   minnesota       he got the gold star for the day   after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners   he took about 1 minute and said   ferc     just get it done           in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward    other commissioners who talked were   arthur   connecticut   hadley   indiana   huelsman   kentucky   nugent   maine all on the positive side   other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do    from the ferc commissioner standpoint   the gold star went to massey   after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn   t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough   he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back   saying the   there has been 7 years of process   and he wants a process that comes to an end         you   ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree          call me if i can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting   sue     612   339

potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing  sense  that supplies might just prove adequate   the result has been a steady and  steep  decline in the november nymex price from   5   63 per mmbtu on october 12 into  the   4   60 s as of october 25   cash prices have followed suit   falling from the  mid      5   50 s to the   4   60 s at the henry hub   and gas is now pricing below residual  fuel oil  in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast   although gas storage  inventories  will begin the winter at levels higher than expected   in cera     s view adequate  supply for the winter is not yet assured   and the market remains subject to a  quick  return to prices well above   5   00 with the first cold snap    storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet   bcf   for the week ended october  20  accompanied by broad   based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift  in  market psychology   last week     s injection rate was 26   5 bcf   or approximately  3   8  bcf per day   above the previous five   year average for those seven days and 58  bcf  above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october  22    with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures  expected  next week   cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2   784 bcf on  october 31     still an all   time low entering the winter   by 26 bcf   see table  1      is this inventory level   enough     not yet   storage inventories this winter  under 15    year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf   22 bcf  above  the previous all   time low   this end   of   march minimum implies total  withdrawals in  the united states this winter of 2   0 trillion cubic feet   tcf     128 bcf above  last year     s  withdrawals   but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2   0 tcf in the face  of a  return to normal weather     and the demand rebound of 3   0 bcf per day it would  bring     will be difficult   although the beginning of a us supply rebound and  growing imports will add approximately 1   0 bcf per day to supplies this  winter    holding withdrawals down requires both of the following      industrial markets     mainly ammonia and methanol  producers     that are now shut down because of high gas prices  must remain shut down   these markets represent  approximately 0   5 bcf per day of demand that could return    should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol      the nearly 1   5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning  residual fuel oil must remain off of gas    in cera     s view   for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis    particularly  as power loads increase this winter   it must become apparent that winter  demand can  be met   the current resid load can return to gas   and storage inventories can  be held  reasonably near the previous record low   that low   758 bcf   occurred in march  1996  and was accompanied by a february average price of   4   41 and a march average  of    3   00 at the henry hub   that spring   however   us productive capability was  nearly  4   0 bcf per day greater than it is today   winter power generation demand was  lower    and there were about 4   5 million fewer residential and commercial gas  customers in  the united states    market fundamentals in cera     s view still support gas prices above those of  resid    which as of this writing is pricing in the   4   75     5   00 per mmbtu range   warm  weather throughout november and into december could reverse this  relationship

natural   gas prices may be good for consumers but hinder new production  by alexei barrionuevo  staff reporter of the wall street journal  10   02   2001  the wall street journal  c 7    copyright   c   2001   dow jones   company   inc      in the wake of last month   s terrorist attacks   natural   gas prices have slid below   2 per million british thermal units   frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural   gas projects    analysts predict that with prices at current levels   projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u   s   could be shelved or canceled    natural   gas prices   which reached highs of nearly   10 per million btus last december   had held to around   3 to   5 per million btus for much of the year   at   2 per million btus and below   producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production    analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand   fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric   utility demand   nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to   2   208 on the new york mercantile exchange    in the boston area   however   different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region   last week   the u   s   coast guard   under pressure from local lawmakers   indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor   lng makes up 15   of new england   s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days   the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists    already   relative to other areas   natural   gas prices have inched higher in new england   where natural   gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market   the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to   1   30 per million btus   said a spokeswoman for distrigas   a unit of belgium   s tractebel sa   but the lack of lng isn   t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural   gas storage is used up    richard grant   ceo of distrigas   says lng has a 30   year safety record at the company   s everett   mass     terminal   while lng is flammable   he says it is unlikely to explode   he adds that   there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual   but until we answer the concerns   we won   t be able to bring a ship in here      deutsche banc alex   brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth   quarter projections for natural   gas prices last week     prior to sept   11   we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back     said jay saunders   a deutsche banc analyst     but all that is out the window now     deutsche banc is now estimating a 20   drop in winter demand in the industrial sector   which accounts for more than a quarter of total u   s   natural   gas consumption   the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage   which is on pace to be full by the end of october    while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers   such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural   gas demand is met   lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms   such as eog resources inc     plan to moderate production in the next two months   gas drilling   rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1   030 at the end of august    even with the increased natural   gas drilling of earlier this year   overall natural   gas supply is expected to increase just 1   this year   as the country   s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them   the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates   increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence    still   the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form   with prices high last winter   el paso corp   and enron corp     among others   said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas   which is gas compressed and frozen to minus   260 degrees fahrenheit     you will see some cancellations and some delays     predicts marshall adkins   an analyst with raymond james   associates in houston    natural   gas prices need to average   3 per million btus on the east coast and   3   50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas   said ronald barone   an analyst with ubs warburg    a spokeswoman for el paso   houston   says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u   s   market   enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004    copyright   2000 dow jones   company   inc   all rights

one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra   kurla complex   enron has been able lease out 10   000 square feet of it to citibank na    against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors   enron will get around rs 1   2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank    the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant   cushman   wakefield   at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot    with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the  short run   companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets    property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors   it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer   as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income    enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12   000 per square foot    this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8   000 to rs 9   000 per square feet   in june 2000   the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125   75 crore when it acquired the four floors   plus car park space   from wockhardt   the pharmaceutical company    the deal was struck at rs 10   500 per sq ft   and included parking space for 101 cars    industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property   and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired    in order for it to break even   it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13   000 per square foot    four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises   a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property      most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase     he added    moreover   the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built   up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises   and enron   s proposition continues to go abegging   said the consultant    copyright   2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers  though hewlett   packard lost   65 billion in market value in a year   ceo carly

there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly   says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in   patient but not passive     the story that accompanies the list     by patience   we mean staying with a company   steadily building influence there   and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge   not promises and self   promotion      fiorina   who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune   s inaugural list in 1998   heads the biggest company     48 billion in revenues last year   run by a woman   and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever   wall

says    as always   the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time   last year   power resided in the technology and internet sectors   but that influence was fleeting   gone from the list this

difference is that riskl 80 focuses on reporting and valuation   in other words   riskl 80 does not offer pricing calculators as does kiodex   s   it seems to me that kiodex   s risk workbench is a more robust solution because it provides decision tools to price opportunities before transacting while riskl 80 is   after the fact   reporting and transacting   it looks to me that when commodity logic launches its risk valuation modules it will become more of a direct competitor to riskl 80    in its initial phase   riskl 80 is offering services to the gas market only   soon   they will offer

ious   coops and munis and with a   500 million asset base initially   their current ten year plan will add   1 billion of investment   their top priorities are connecting generation and load    michael dworkin   because transmission is a common good   construction affects all parties not just one party   the environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view   the idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi   state projects   although ferc has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by fcc   state input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered    mark maher   ferc must consider the unique characteristics of the west when considering congestion management   lmp is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations   rto west is developing a planning process which will give the rto the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future   the rto needs a strong centralized planning process    laura manz   the various aspects of planning are connected   pricing   lmp   is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources   no competitor should have an advantage over another   the rto needs a central planning process but it shouldn   t push solutions   the market should decide on solutions    masheed rosenqvist   the morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk   the planning discussion is not about what we have now   but about how to avoid future congestion   the commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases   the issues that need to be answered are   how can merchant transmission be compensated   should transmission projects be open to rfps   is ferc open to market based pricing for expansions    steve walton   the most important thing for ferc to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment   the rto debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled   for expansion to go forward   there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party   you are always going to have muddy issues in planning   for instance if a 138 kv line is all that is needed to day   but future considerations of scare right   of   way say a 345 kv line should be built   who pays for the extra cost   in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process   appeal able to ferc   to decide such matters    discussion  kevin kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose   most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding   michael dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution   i   e   least cost planning   this lead to discussion of the need for the rto to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions    commissioner massey asked about whether the system was   a   under built and needed lots of expansion so don   t worry about overbuilding or   b   transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities   the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process   michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions   laura manz felt that the term   under built   is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties    dick o   neil asked if lmp will work in the west   mark maher said it wouldn   t   laura manz said it applies everywhere because of physics   they manage hydro facilities in pjm   michael dworkin said lmp means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed   bpa is looking pricing model but lmp won   t work   steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch   but given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some   tweaks   like bilaterals and allow operator self   schedule output levels to permit river coordination   hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis   pjm has hydro   but not 70   as in the northwest   implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal    in the summation at the end of the panel   four principles were listed     1   rto must provide information     2   rto should identify solutions     3   rto should be unbiased and   4   the rto should be accountable   the disagreement was over the last two points   michael dworkin felt that   3   unbiased   was critical and that   4   accountability   was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance   jose delgado said and transco can   t be unbiased since it provides services   although the iso above it can be   but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake   this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues    steve',\n",

accounting when the value of certain assets     most notably in telecommunications     have declined precipitously      investors have had several opportunities to question enron   s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined     launer said    some analysts   though   cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke      this is an inquiry   not an investigation   and i cannot imagine enron   s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal     said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey      it   s easy for the market to kick a company when its down   but these challenges do not last for a solid company   and we think enron is one      the price of shares in the company is down 75   this year    copyright   2000 dow jones

fastow    the securities and exchange commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which mr fastow has   or had   links    enron chairman kenneth lay said in a statement     we welcome this request   we will co   operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest      questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write   down of more than   1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses    the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc   yesterday they fell another   5   30     3   80   to   20   75 in early trading    according to the annual report the   related party transactions     as enron describes them   took place in 1999 and 2000   resulting in losses of   16 m and   36 m respectively    mr lay said that auditors approved the deals   but would not give further details of what they were    they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co   investment jp      we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done     added mr lay    the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear   though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions    enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us   investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company   s credit rating    an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion    the sec inquiry is   informal     says the company   the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday   the day of the results announcement   the sec declined to

mirror company  shares of enron corp   set a 52   week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston   based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive    enron   the world   s largest energy trader   said it had voluntarily provided information on   certain related   party transactions   that had been previously disclosed to the sec      we welcome this request     said kenneth l   lay   enron chairman and chief executive      we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest     he said    the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron   which has seen investments sour in telecommunications   retail electricity sales and water    investors have battered the company   s stock   which once sold for nearly   85 a share in the last year   and many have criticized enron   s stingy meting out of financial information   but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock   noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn    in august   enron chief executive jeffrey k   skilling   one of the main architects of the company   s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit   stunned wall street by resigning    skilling cited personal   family   related reasons   but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company   s stock price contributed to his departure    on monday   enron shares plunged   5   40   or nearly 21     to close at   20   65 on the new york stock exchange    enron   s stock has lost nearly 40   of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third   quarter loss of   618 million after   1   01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments    but the charge also included   35 million related to what enron described only as the   early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity      in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings   the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions    but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s   fastow   enron   s chief financial officer   and that enron had whittled   1   2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a   1   2   billion note it had received from the partnership   shareholder equity now stands at   9   5 billion    the limited partnership   called ljm 2   and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock   the journal reported    lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed    a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron   s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court    many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes   but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them   analyst say    investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information   making it difficult to analyze the company   s complex web of businesses    and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released    analyst m   carol coale   who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston   downgraded enron to a   hold   from a   buy   rating monday out of such frustration    coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron    but bob christensen   energy analyst with first albany corp     said that despite enron   s recent difficulties   the bulk of the business remains strong      i continue to tell investors that 70   of this company   s business is growing at a 26   rate   and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on     he said    investors are panicking because of a   bad news story that doesn   t reflect

              " 'Subject  access on the block   international transmission auctions   cera a  lert   december 20   2000  title   access on the block   international transmission auctions are opening  european power markets  e   mail category   cera insight  cera knowledge area   european power  despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission  system operators   regulators   and the european commission in florence    auctions of international transmission capacity   itc   in france   the united  kingdom   denmark   belgium   italy   austria   switzerland   slovenia   and the  netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single european marketplace    however   the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved   the most significant of these include the potential for gaming    third   party transit   and the allocation of auction proceeds   as they stand    these issues   cera believes   are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme    nevertheless   current plans to open most of europe   s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001    international auctions are opening markets  a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001   see table 1     in cera   s view auctions for  itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas      increasing market transparency   the posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly   monthly   and daily bases will facilitate the market   s  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity   for the first time    signals for new transmission investment   power flows   and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market      increasing cross   border trade   although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially   the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade   secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade        increasing price correlation   auctions will replace nonmarket   based  allocation methods such as long   term capacity reservation   the dynamic  character of shorter   term auctions   combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity   should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market   in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points      increasing competition   once players have secured access to itc at a given  price   they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals   the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike   resulting in  greater competition at the national level      reducing the competitiveness of imports   the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets   final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import      spurring investment in transmission   the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links   access to international  transmission capacity between the netherlands   germany   and belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros   see http       www   tso   auction   org for  details       auctions for access into spain   france   and italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets    connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids   or more accurately commercial grids   are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis   the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators    even so   the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers   in cera   s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions      third   party transit   the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid   this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission   s objective of a single european power market   the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third   party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach      transaction   based scheme   although still transactional in nature   tied to a  specific deal     auctions fall within the european commission   s stated  preference for market   based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity   it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets   action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting   counter trading   or redispatching      gaming of auctions   auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most   in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided   even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity   tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power      allocating auction proceeds   one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players   this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation   suppliers   or traders   it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid   as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation        end      come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001     shooting the rapids

and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification   licensing   and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce   ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity   as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions   as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines   the order   which sets new  precedent in its broadness   also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale   market  portion of demand   response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side   ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30

pipeline projects into california  and the west   including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications   and urging all licensees to review  their ferc   licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity      among the actions ferc takes are to   1   require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council   wscc   to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term   2   waive prior notice requirements for any

issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction   on hydro issues   ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc   licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources    in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure   ferc  asked for comments   again by march 30   on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection   including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates

be of  service by november 1   2002    in his dissent to the order   commissioner massey argued the order focuses on    quick fixes     and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california   the order also   fails to address price relief     noted  massey   massey also called for a full federal power act   fpa   section 206  investigation of california issues   which would allow for the possibility of  refunds   on transmission incentive provisions   massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no   2000   the financial provisions   he said    appeared to be   just throwing money at the problem     while generally  disappointed with the order   massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order   many of the suggestions in the order are the   same  actions as authorized last may     said massey     they were good ideas then    and they are good ideas now     he concluded    for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted    chairman hebert said the order was designed to   squeeze every additional mw  of supply available   and to encourage the conservation of mw   and stressed  that ferc is   doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems      he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in

 in the past two weeks   the stock is trading at about its book value   begging the question   so how much is it worth anyway    the answer is far from easy    ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm   the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand    just a glance at the wide   range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point   in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities    one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets    by enron   s own definition   the company houses four main divisions   enron wholesale services   enron energy services   enron transportation services   and enron broadband services    wholesale services houses the company   s energy marketing business and enrononline   this segment accounts for the bulk of enron   s profits   and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today    not only does enron trade gas   oil and coal   but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper   petrochemicals   lumber   plastics and even weather risk    enron energy services is the company   s retail arm   the company provides electricity   gas and commodity risk management services through this division    enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25   000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9   8 billion cubic feet per day   through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15   of the natural gas the u   s   needs   the segment also includes portland general   a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co     nwn   for   1   9 billion in cash and stock    in addition   the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband

renewable energy corp   as well as methanol and mtbe plants    through enron   s unconsolidated affiliates   the company also has investments in additional water assets   a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things    what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company   s financial structure    enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter   and doesn   t expect to do so until nov   15   when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations    without the balance sheet   some of the details needed for calculating a company   s value are missing    also   much still remains unknown about the company   s obligations to its off   balance sheet financing vehicles    using what

as dynegy inc   and aquila inc   have taken a knock as a result of enron corp   s recent woes   but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered      the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company     said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald     i don   t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact     he said    enron   s widespread use of complex off   balance   sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company   s stock   causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks    and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt   nobody does so to the same extent as enron   analysts said      enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off   balance sheet transactions     said prudential securities analyst carole coale    uncomfortable with disclosure  coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron   s peers about such deals   but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron   s profits    el paso corp     for example is channeling over   1 billion in off   balance   sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants    analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron    el paso   s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company   s earnings    dynegy   s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy   s assumption of a leadership role among u   s   energy marketers in many investors   eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price   earnings ratio    asked about dynegy   s use of off   balance   sheet financing   spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron   saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock   nor any   related party transactions      former high   fliers shunned  analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate   investors are shunning trading   oriented companies   whose stocks had previously commanded high price   earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines    in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer   trader like aquila   whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks    on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos   and duke energy corp     which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an   asset   light   philosophy    williams   stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke   s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u   s   stock market    j   p   morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface      enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering   but it didn   t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures     he said    credit lyonnais securities   howald had a simpler explanation   saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided   people began to see enron for what it was      trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big     he said     i think the days of the big valuations are over     he added    copyright   2000 dow jones

investors seek more disclosure    by carolyn koo  10   31   2001  reuters english news service    c   reuters limited 2001    new york   oct 31   reuters     shares of enron corp   snapped back from 10 straight days of losses on wednesday after investors said the deep plunge had made the stock attractive    shares of houston   based enron   which lost more than   17 billion in market capitalization during the rout   surged almost 27 percent in heavy trade   making the stock second   most active on the new york stock exchange and third   biggest gainer by percentage    despite the surge   investors and analysts said they were still dissatisfied with enron   s failure to disclose key information and said the rebound could prove short   lived for the largest trader of natural gas and power in north america      at this level the stock is attracting money   however   the near term is not going to be good     said tim ghriskey   president of money managers ghriskey capital partners llc      we don   t own any enron   we have in the past and sold a while ago   we   ve been tempted a couple of times during the slide   but the information flow is not that strong   and there is potential for more negative surprises      enron closed up   2   74   or 24   6 percent   to   13   90 on the nyse   the stock surged to an intraday high of   14   17   recouping the past two days of losses   but is far from   33   84   the closing price for enron on oct   16   the last day before the 10   day tumble began    enron shares have been hammered over the past two weeks amid a series of unwelcome disclosures   including murky off   balance   sheet deals with partnerships once run by chief financial officer andrew fastow    the disclosures forced fastow   s ouster   led to a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron and caused at least one credit rating agency to cut enron   s senior   debt credit status    the company said fastow   s removal was aimed at assuaging investor concerns as the almost daily disclosures forced it to draw down about   3 billion from existing credit lines    trying to quantify   worst   case scenario    but that   s not enough   say analysts and investors      enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures     said nitin khandkar   a portfolio manager with dubai   based al majid investment co     which owns enron stock     the accounting policies it follows should not be merely legal but should also reflect the company   s true profitability      as an industry heavyweight     investors expect enron to come clean on the controversial issues     he said    one issue enron would do well to address is its partnerships and the liabilities they may have      people are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst   case scenario could be     said mike heim   an analyst with a   g   edwards   sons   of the existing partnerships      instead of dismissing the worst   case scenario   i think it would make sense to mathematically show that   here   s what happens under such a scenario   and then let analysts make their own assessments      enron   s refusal to make public its finances with greater transparency is a hallmark of arrogance   noted one academic      the lack of transparency is an arrogance that says     i don   t have to explain anything because if people don   t want to buy my shares   they can just sit and spin       said paul kedrosky   a professor at the university of british columbia who sits on the board of exponentia   a company dedicated to improving communications with shareholders      it   s an arrogance that says     i do not have to disclose anything until i am forced to       kedrosky said     the crucial thing is to disclose early

commentary   david wilson is a columnist for bloomberg news    the opinions expressed are his own      princeton   new jersey   oct   31   bloomberg       international  business machines corp     s press release about its third   quarter  results included this statement   attributed to louis gerstner    chairman and chief executive officer        ibm   s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the  technology industry   or any industry        the largest maker of computers and provider of computer  services wasn   t the only company to cite its balance sheet   a  statistical summary of what a company owned   what it owed   and  what was left over for shareholders on a specific date    general electric co     the largest company by stock market  value   and citigroup inc     the no   1 financial   services company    made similar references in their third   quarter releases    none of the companies really showed people what they were  telling them   ibm   general electric and citigroup are among 19  members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent  quarterly releases didn   t include balance sheets    the evidence will come only when the companies submit their  quarterly reports to the u   s   securities and exchange commission    balance sheets are required in the so   called 10   q filings   along  with the 10   k filings that cover the full year    not much publicity  by then   statistics about the companies   assets   liabilities  and shareholders   equity   the accounting terms for what   s owned    what   s owed and what   s left over   will be rather outdated    u   s   companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter  to submit 10   q reports   and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year  for 10   k reports    these filings usually don   t arrive until weeks after the  publication of earnings releases   so it   s easy to overlook the  additional information they provide   especially when it doesn   t  receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does    yet the recent example of enron corp       another company that  omits balance sheets from press releases     provides evidence that  investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at  their own peril    enron   the largest energy trader   reported   1   01 billion in      non   recurring     costs in the third quarter from an expansion  into water   telecommunications and retail   energy sales   the  expense contributed to a   618 million loss for the quarter    these numbers were part of the houston   based company   s income  statement   a summary of sales   costs and expenses   and profits or  losses during a specified time period   income statements are the  cornerstone of any company   s earnings release    billion   dollar numbers  the release didn   t even mention a larger figure that affected  the balance sheet   a   1   2 billion drop in shareholders   equity  during the quarter resulting from the company   s repurchase of 55  million shares from two partnerships   ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co    investment lp   that helped finance projects   andrew fastow   who  ran both partnerships   was ousted from his job as chief financial  officer last week    chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a  subsequent conference call    such a one   two punch dealt a blow to investors   fortunes    since oct   17   the day after the earnings release   enron   s shares  have fallen each day and have lost two   thirds of their value   the  low of   10   90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992    enron   s third   quarter statement referred only to a loss on      finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity     which  contributed to   544 million of investment losses   the size of that  item was later put at   35 million    the latter number amounts to just 3   5 percent of the overall  figure for     non   recurring     costs   and less than 1 percent of the  company   s   47   6 billion in revenue for the quarter    growing debt burden  the   1   2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in  dollars   but also in percentage terms   enron had   11   74 billion of  shareholders   equity as of june 30   according to the balance sheet  in its second   quarter 10   q filing   the reduction equaled more than  10 percent of that total    among other things   the balance sheet also shows that the  company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year   s  first half   short   term debt   due in one year or less   doubled to    3   46 billion   long   term debt   maturing in more than one year    rose 9   4 percent to   9   36 billion    there   s even more to the story of enron   s indebtedness   the  company guaranteed   3   3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and  marlin water trust   which bought some of its power plants   unless  they pay off the debt by reselling the plants   the company may  have to come up with the difference    nevertheless   any summary of a company   s financial position  provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone    this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better  shape     ibm   general electric and citigroup   to name three    knowing by showing  other members of the dow industrials that wait until their  filings to provide balance sheets are

open the attached word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order   which was issued this afternoon   alan comnes  the full order is available at   http       www   ferc   fed   us   electric   bulkpower   htm  summary of ferc   s  order establishing prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for the california wholesale electric markets and establishing an investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets    issued april 26   2001    effective date     price mitigation is effective may 29   2001     iso needs to have its day   ahead proxy price ready on 5   28    physical withholding     to prevent physical withholding   the plan will require sellers with pga   s to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade   all california generators   even those not subject to ferc price regulation   will be required to sell into the iso   s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso   s interstate transmission lines   hydroelectric facilities will be exempted     this requirement to provide power is for all hours   24   7   for lyr    price mitigation   the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market   during stage 1   2 and 3 emergencies in the iso   s real time market   each generator   other than hydro   with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator   s heat curve   emission rates   gas costs and emission costs   plus   2   mwh for o emissions are to be based on cantor fitzgerald environmental brokerage services   the iso will publish by 8   00 am   the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared   these figures   for the next day   will be based on the prior day   s gas daily and cantor fitzgerald data   a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators   highest bid sets the clearing price   each gas   fired generator must file with ferc and the iso within 5 days   on a confidential basis   heat and emission rates for each generating unit   the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator   including maintenance and operating costs   generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability     although the following qualification is made     however   all public utility rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market   based rates   discussed infra     presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior     in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price   the generator must   within 7 days of the end of each month   file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price   ferc explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the   all delivery point   index it has adopted   ferc has 60 days to review   act   no opportunity costs in real time   marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost    underscheduling penalites     ferc acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place   thus   although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in r   t at capped prices   doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective   100   mwh penalty   see p   20 of the ferc order    new generation     new generation is not exempted from the commission   s price mitigation measures    demand response     beginning june 1   only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids   ferc is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive     this requirement is in effect for all hours   24   7      outages     pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages the iso is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages   including periodic reports to the commission    term   order expires one year from date of issuance    rto filing   california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect   the rto filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in order no   2000    iso reporting   on september 14   2001   iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built   comments are due in 15 days   quarterly reports thereafter    revocation of market based rate authority and refunds   the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on   1   no physical withhold of capacity   and   2   no inappropriate bidding behavior   inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior   an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate   in addition     hockey stick   bids are expressly prohibited   i   e   bidding 95   at marginal cost and 5   at a much higher level     other prohibited bidding practices identified include   pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs    west   wide section 206 investigation   opens a section 206 investigation concerning the j   r of wholesale power in the wscc other than sales to the caiso market   ferc requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation   however its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time   markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of r   t   spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7   within a control area   ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california   comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations   although it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non   california pnw   the ferc sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order    nox limits in california     must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law   however   it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement   just include the fines as part of the price bid   also if nox is limited   may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price    surcharge to pay past amount due     comments are due in 30 days on   1   whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and   2   the effect this surcharge would have on the pg   e bankruptcy filing    treatment of the caiso   s market stabilization plan   msp     the ferc rejects the caiso   s msp saying that ferc   s plan for market mitigation is sufficient   it expressly rejects caiso   s plan to create a day   ahead and hour   ahead energy markets are expressly reject and tells caiso to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets   unfortunately   it does not expressly reject caiso   s plan to cut exports   in general   no mention was made as to issue of exports of power from california although the statement that caiso must become a real rto would support the notion that caiso must honor firm schedules on its system      recap of dates

announced that ferc will hold a special meeting nov   1 to  issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the california  wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway    only one item was discussed   an order resolving the amoco complaint over el  paso   s capacity allocation   in the order   the commission finds that el  paso   s allocation of delivery point capacity at topock is unjust    unreasonable   the commission directs el paso to assign primary point rights  to its shippers using a one   time assignment process outlined in the order    if elections for primary point capacity exceed available space   el paso will  pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an  iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their  firm capacity rights   chairman hoecker said this case illustrates the fact  that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the  overbooking of airline capacity

allowed to file comments to ferc within 20 days   however   she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process     the commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations   may reject her recommendations   or change something   i would expect that the commission would adopt many of her recommendations   while allowing further mediated   type discussions on some issues   hopefully   ferc will adopt many of our suggested changes     judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of the grid group and the southern   etal   group   then provides the stakeholder participants   comments   almost verbatim from all submissions to her     while she states that the process should keep moving quickly   she does not adopt any timeframes   we will comment that ferc should retain its dec 02 day 2 start date   for lmp   financial rights congestion model to be implemented      the attachments below are her report   the southern   etal proposal and the grid pricing   congestion management   operating   and planning protocols   without any changes     clearly   our response ferc will include our proposed changes to the documents   highlights from her report below    she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest  she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input   regardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc  her opinion is that the   grid   entergy   gridsouth and gridflorida utility sponsored   model     transco in rto   lmp   financial rights congestion management   is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of order no   2000 based on a   best practices   analysis of other rtos and commission precedent   this is good because enron generally favors the grid model   however   she does provide the commission information on southern   etal     s proposal   independent system administrator     like national grid   type   in her report   even though she has concerns that the southern   etal model is not order no   2000 compliant   the southern   etal   model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and lmp in real time   with penalties   and significant control area responsibilities   the significant aspects of the grid model are discussed below    grid governance   rto is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement   the independent market administrator   ima     the ima was added to facilitate public power participation   worried that transmission owner on top   even if divested from generation   would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution     the ima would administer the markets   exercise operational authority over the transmission system   administer one oasis   with one process for interconnection and transmission requests     and assume the security coordinator function   she strongly encourages this split    good stakeholder advisory committee   provides majority and minority views   and an independent market monitor to monitor the rto and the markets  allows for independent transmission companies   entergy wants to be one     with rto oversight  describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation   such as switching transmission elements   pursuant to operating procedures approved by the rto   ima   recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as rto matures     protocols should be subject to further discussion    rto   transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration   including rate changes and tariff filings  all load under the rates   terms and conditions of oatt   gridsouth group has appealed this part of earlier commission orders   and   thus   retains their rights should they win on appeal    4 transmission pricing zones initially   entergy   southern   gridsouth   and gridflorida   allows for participant funded   direct assigned   and merchant transmission   transmission rates to loads in rto will be zonal   for existing facilities   and regional charge   for new facilities   other than those above     there will be one   through and out rate     plus a grid management charge for rto operation    encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to oatt  financial rights   lmp   includes   real time spot market     is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model   from pjm and spp       many details need to be worked out in continued discussions   model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges   fch     stakeholder process needs to be continued for fch allocation   auction and non   discriminatory release   the grid model includes a   balancing resource   requirement that we will provide comments against  will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported     control area operators required to provide before such market establishment  rto runs single oasis and independently calculates atc and ttc  rto   transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process  numerous comments from marketers   ipps on reduction of control area functions   all of our comments from last week   s response are included    judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners     1   many are still concerned that ferc had not conducted a   cost   benefit   analysis and had concerns over the costs   she responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the   economies of scale   and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure   in any event   ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions     2   concerned about cost shifting   mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allowed     3   concern that se rto would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to rto and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets     4   concern that se rto may prematurely put southern states into retail open access   concerns with cal     judge encourages the commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners    i think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant   jump start   it gave to the se rto process due to the significant role played by judge mccartney and her team on focusing the discussions   furthermore   the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a   best practices   pjm   spp cornerstone type real time spot energy market with lmp pricing and financial congestion hedges and an rto with an independent board structure that accommodates a for   profit rto entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process   the commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions   or   at a minimum   consider similar mediated   jump starts

copyright 2001    it was an irresistible proposition   borrow billions of dollars   pay no interest   reap millions in tax breaks   and then wait for the debt to simply disappear   that was the promise of zero   coupon convertible bonds   and companies from enron to merrill lynch binged on what seemed like free money    but   of course   there was a catch   for this scenario to play out   a company   s stock price had to rise sharply     and quickly   that   s because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity     if the stock tanked   the bonds would no longer be worth converting   so to make them more attractive to buyers   companies had to build in an escape hatch   if the stock price failed to rise sufficiently   investors could   put     that is   sell   the bonds back to the company     in many cases   after just one year    and that   s exactly what   s about to happen     to the tune of some   65 billion over the next three years   stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids   the prospect of conversion is now absurd   it simply won   t happen   so bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can   and because of the put feature   that is possible   suddenly companies like tyco   comcast   and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they   d never have to pay    that could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies   after all   they   re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due   huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders   companies without enough cash     and the majority fall into this camp     are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew   that means sharply reduced earnings   especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings     prime candidates for killer refinancing costs   some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt   creating significant shareholder dilution   especially at current depressed prices   to make matters worse   this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking     this is a ticking time bomb     warns margaret patel   manager of the pioneer high yield bond fund   a top   performing junk fund    the seeds of this mess were sown in mid   2000   when the stock market started to falter   companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling   zero   coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn   t have to make cash interest payments on the bonds   hence the name   zero       instead issuers offered an up   front discount     for instance   investors would buy a bond for   700 and collect   1   000 when it matured    companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares   but the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantly     in many cases   by more than 50     with that protective feature   called the conversion premium     zeros took off   corporate issuers would pay no interest   and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels   the debt would be swept away into equity     if the bonds are converted   it   s a home run for everybody     says jonathan cohen   vice president of convertible   bond analysis at deutsche bank    that four   bagger   of course   depends entirely on the stock price rising   if it doesn   t   the bondholders   armed with that handy put feature   can simply sell the bonds back to the company   great for bondholders   but not so hot for the company or its shareholders   but   hey   what are the odds of that happening     cfos and ceos believe that their stock will just continue to go up     says cohen     they don   t worry about the bond getting put      if all this seems a little complicated   that   s because it is   a real   life example should help   california   based electric utility calpine issued   1 billion in zeros in april to refinance existing debt   at the time   the company   s stock was trading at about   55 a share     severely undervalued in the opinion of company management     we really didn   t want to sell equity at that point     says bob kelly   calpine   s senior vice president of finance   so the company instead opted to sell zeros   setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37      still   with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile   the bonds weren   t exactly a screaming buy for investors   so calpine added the put feature   investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price   eliminating any downside risk    things haven   t exactly worked out as management had hoped   the stock has since plummeted to   25   and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense   so it   s looking as though calpine will be liable for the   1 billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this april   there   s also the refinancing cost   according to kelly   calpine   s borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8   5       an extra   85 million per year in cash     obviously   nobody plans for their stock to go down     kelly says     i don   t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put      calpine   s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk     if you are a borderline investment   grade company   a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world     notes anand iyer   head of global convertible research at morgan stanley   the problem is   there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there   jeff seidel   credit suisse first boston   s head of convertible   bond research   estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category   and others are at risk of

contract manufacturer solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk   it has   845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this january   and another   4   2 billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years   because of slower   than   expected sales   the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies   and if solectron   s credit is downgraded   the zeros would slide into junk status   a situation that could cost the company     and its shareholders     tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges    refinancing isn   t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros   companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds     up to 3   of the amount raised   if the debt is sold back   many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one   year loan     they   re getting bad advice     claims one banker who didn   t want to be named     look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into      as if those potential consequences were not scary enough   shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued   that   s because some 40   are bought by hedge funds   which short the company   s stock   sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price   at the same time that they buy the bonds   if the stock goes down   the shorts make money from their position   if it goes up   they profit by converting the bond to stock   this hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet   at least for a while   grocery chain supervalu   for example   recently lost 10   of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing   185 million in zeros    despite all the pitfalls   the love affair with such pollyanna bonds continues   thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide   in fact   the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing   even better   thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code   companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they   re actually paying   all they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail   verizon communications   for instance   would pay 0   25   annual interest on its   3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below 60   of the issue   s conversion price   in the eyes of the irs   oddly   that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction   for tax purposes   of 7   5       the same rate it pays on its regular debt     why   trust us   you don   t want to know     that adds up to an annual deduction of more than   200 million   even if verizon never shells out a dime in interest   not surprisingly   more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses     it   s an incredible deal for them     says vadim iosilevich   who runs a hedge fund at alexandra investment management     not only are they raising cheap money   they   re also doing tax arbitrage      so despite the enormous risks to shareholders   companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip

cmgi     managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business   the latest example is enron   whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to dynegy    once considered one of the country   s most innovative companies   enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest   the journalistic accounts of enron   s struggles drip with schadenfreude   hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage    we hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation   we agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed   high profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms   but no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge   enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value        deregulation and market competition   enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the u   s   where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers   and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit   enron was the leader in pioneering this business    market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the u   s     and is spreading to europe   latin america   and asia   the winners have been consumers   who have paid lower prices   and investors   who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient   the contrary experience of california   the poster child of those who would re   regulate the power industry   is an example of not enough deregulation        innovation and the   de   integration   of power contracts   under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity   customers were offered a one   size   fits   all contract   for many customers   this system was inflexible and inefficient   like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload   enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer    to do this   enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts   starting with price and volume   location   time   etc     and offered customers choices on each one   again   consumers won   enron   s investors did too   because enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors   arguably   enron is the embodiment of what economist joseph schumpeter called the   process of creative destruction     but creative destroyers are not necessarily likable   pleasant folks   which may be part of enron   s problem today        minimization of transaction costs and frictions   enron extended the logic of de   integration to other industries   an integrated paper company   for instance   owns forests   mills   pulp factories   and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller   specialized firms   enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of   customers   and   suppliers     enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free   market terms would be better than those of the internal operations   the development of free   market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy        exploiting the optionality in networks   in the old regulated environment   natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline   enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources   opening the customer to the benefits of competition   and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies   enron benefited from controlling switches on the network   so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use   and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons   this policy   picked up by others in the industry   created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers        rigorous risk assessment   the strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed   and of very strong internal controls   enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere   particularly with the advent of enron online   where enron made new positions valued at over   4 billion each day   it became essential to have up   to   the   second information on company   wide positions   prices and ability to deliver    the unexpected bad news from enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm   but with fears among trading partners about enron   s ability to finance its trading activity   in a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite   counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance   it was the erosion in equity   rather than trading risk   that destroyed the firm        a culture of urgency   innovation and high expectations   enron   s corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all   the hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic   hierarchical   formal   slow   and full of excuses   and the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company     enron only 15 years ago     is even duller and slower   enron became bumptious   impatient   lean   fast   innovative   and demanding   it bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses   create markets   and transfer within the firm    success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion   and an open   office design fostered brainstorming   the firm   s organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs   this was a lightning rod for the firm   s detractors   and yet   it could serve as a model for more hide   bound enterprises to emulate    enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of american business   it created a ruckus in once   quiet corners of the business economy   it rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business   it thrived on volatility    the proposed sale of enron to dynegy risks the loss of a major r   d establishment   especially given dynegy   s track record as a second mover following enron   s lead   beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time   consuming antitrust review   dynegy   s greater challenge will be to find a way to make enron   s spirit of innovation its own   or so we all should hope   because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries           messrs   bodily and bruner are professors at the university of virginia   s graduate school of business administration    copyright   2000 dow jones

corporation   people close to the discussions said today    enron is looking to sell wessex water   of britain   as well as other noncore assets in india and brazil   after a financial crisis nearly brought its main energy trading business to a halt   that crisis led to enron   s decision earlier this month to be acquired by dynegy inc     a much smaller rival    the german bank   westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale of dusseldorf   or westlb   is among several suitors for wessex water   people close to the discussions said   the sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals like thames water   owned by rwe of germany   but such a combination would most likely incur a long review by regulators   who might either block the merger on antitrust grounds   or exact stiff concessions   industry experts said    wessex water is likely to be sold for more than     1 billion     1   4 billion   but less than the     1   4 billion that enron paid for it in 1998   analysts said        in hindsight   we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses       kenneth l   lay   enron   s chairman and chief executive   told analysts in a conference call last week   those investments     have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined       he said   citing the azurix water business   of which wessex water is a part   and energy assets in brazil and india    executives from enron were not immediately available for comment today   westlb executives declined to comment    westlb has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in britain   bidding for british telecommunications   phone network and the nation   s railway tracks controlled by the troubled railtrack   which is restructuring under government supervision   neither of those bids has progressed

  19   2001  the wall street journal  cl    copyright   c   2001   dow jones   company   inc      when at   t last week completed the second   biggest bond sale in history     capping one of the busiest bond periods in years     it came as welcome news amid fears of a credit crunch   here was new money   meaning new spending on plants   equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump    that   10   9 billion at   t deal   and a slew of similar bond deals from big companies ranging from boeing and anheuser   busch to kraft foods and general motors   may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on   that is because corporations   like homeowners   are in the midst of a refinancing boom    corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap   but because they often can   t get money in other crucial markets   in particular   they are sidestepping the commercial paper market     short   term corporate ious used to finance day   to   day operations   where rates traditionally are lowest     because investors are unwilling to finance many well   known corporations    the result has been a huge jump in bond sales   the majority of which are used to reduce existing debt   since the sept   11 terrorist attacks   about   135 billion in investment   grade bonds have been sold   up from about   78 billion in the year   earlier period   overall issuance this year is likely to set a record   clearing   600 billion   compared with   411 billion in 2000      the driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short   term commercial paper to long   term debt     says john lonski   chief economist at moody   s investors service   a credit   rating agency    usually   rising bond issuance presages economic growth   in 1991   corporations sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates   but then   companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations   a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990 s    this time around   the surge in bond deals won   t pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference   though   as in the case of the millions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments   it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate   balance sheets and help to fund some of the companies   day   to   day operations    not all of the money being raised is to refinance short   term debt   of course   and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation   s biggest borrowers have ready access to funding if they need it    but most companies are similar to at   t   which last week provided the biggest refinancing example yet    over the next three months   the telecom company was facing   6   5 billion in expiring commercial paper   under normal conditions   corporations pay off maturing commercial paper by   rolling over   that debt   or issuing new commercial paper to replace the old   but rolling over commercial paper became much harder for at   t after moody   s cut the company   s short   term and long   term credit ratings   through the bond deal   at   t raised money at relatively attractive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial   paper market    other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercial   paper market through bonds   loans or revolving credit lines     the ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital markets     says meredith coffey   senior vice president at loan pricing corp     a debt   market   analysis company    for the most extreme cases   the bond markets don   t offer refuge   enron   hammered by a third   quarter loss of   618 million that led to a string of downgrades   drew down   3   3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper   it then turned to its banks for an additional   1 billion loan to pay off more commercial   paper investors   thus tiding it over until it could merge with rival dynegy    most investment   grade companies aren   t nearly so bad off   and thus have ready access to bond investors   general motors   for instance   had little trouble selling   6 billion in debt last month   while ford motor easily sold bonds totalling   9   4 billion    but the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment   grade companies are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money    take ford   standard   poor   s and moody   s downgraded ford   s debt ratings last month to triple   b   plus and single   a   3   respectively   with that rating   ford is far enough down the spectrum of investment   grade debt that many of the ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won   t touch it   meaning that it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt   ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial   paper market    boyce greer   the money   market group leader at fidelity investments   says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability     even before they get downgraded     you can   t wait around for a rating agency   to downgrade a company       he says    moody   s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year   thus   the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to   1   4 trillion at the end of october   down from   1   6 trillion at the end of

modern   rules of corporate governance   according to samuel oubadia the 37   year   old manager of the russia fund      but they are getting more open     mr   oubadia said   though russia   s lax financial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign investors   with   49 million in assets   the pilgrim russia fund invests between 90   and 95   in russian stock   with the balance held in cash      while the global economy is slowing   russia is still in an expansion mode     mr   oubadia said   after years of economic reforms   consumer spending is up 10   and the

oil prices also worked wonders for the russian economy   which is largely dependent on oil and gas   more recently   however   falling oil prices have threatened the companies   profit growth    but

   there will be none for russian oil companies this year   you invest because of the stocks   low valuation     mr   oubadia said   adding that most of the russian oil companies still trade well below the world   wide average for the sector    yukos oil is one of the fund   s largest investments   making up about 12   of the fund   s holdings   surgutneftegaz and lukoil holdings also make up more than 5   each of pilgrim russia   s assets   while mr   oubadia said the companies should be able to handle falling oil prices   partly by cutting production   he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile russian stock market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks      can russian markets do well with lower prices for oil     he asked     the short answer is yes   but how low will prices drop     mr   oubadia acknowledged that weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas into other russian sectors   including telecom stocks and

2001  houston   cbs   mw       in the wake of the sept   11 terrorist attacks   one  of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market  maintained by enron    the attacks highlighted the houston company   s strength as a manager of  risk during periods of heightened uncertainty   through its trading  centers   the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility  in oil   natural gas   and electricity markets   as well as other  commodities    although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked  planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks   its trading  activity resumed the next day    by coming back online so fast     we made the decision to provide some  stability in the market     said vance meyer   an enron spokesman     the  customers really appreciated the fact that we were there   providing a  place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market      in a financial sense   enron   ene   didn   t suffer   meyer said   but  employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken    nick humber   who worked for enron   s wind energy business   died aboard a  los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center      we have offices in washington and new york   and people who had friends  that died or were affected in some way     meyer said   we also had traders  who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the  planes hit      the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york  mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks   may have increased  volatility   a boon to the group     said bob christensen   analyst at  fac   equities   companies that can defray volatility by helping customers  manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business   he said    managing risk is what enron does best   market players say   and that  strength should help the company going forward as u   s   businesses try to  recover from the impact of september 11   through its enrononline  platform   the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling  about   3 billion a day   meyer said      the world at large has become more risk averse   and enron   which is in  the business of risk mitigation   should benefit from that     said glen  hilton   senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new  power fund   which has a stake in enron     with energy risk and prices  potentially going up   they   ll be the first number on many cfos   speed  dial      other companies do what enron does   but it   s the best positioned to  succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power  trading   measured in terms of volume   duke energy   duk   is the  next   largest competitor   but it has one   third of enron   s volume    high profile departure  that   s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on  the skids since last year   though it grew 151 percent on the top line in  2000   other problems notwithstanding   including its money   losing  broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland  general electric   enron   s largest black eye came in mid   august when  jeffrey skilling   chief executive since february   resigned abruptly    john hammerschmidt   senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy  and power technology fund   said he   freaked out   when skilling left and  managers immediately divested the turner large   cap portfolios of enron  holdings   despite its status as a growth player   turner had re   entered  the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation   at the  time   enron was trading in the mid to high   40 s      this is a premier company and a premier industry     he said   adding  that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock    one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being  long on power when power prices were collapsing   hammerschmidt said    that has not materialized    whatever the problems were   hammerschmidt said   he felt them to be  manageable   when skilling walked out   hammerschmidt began to believe  some of the rumors might be true      in our experience   when somebody in power leaves for no reason    there   s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous     he  said    management continuity  now he   s looking to get back in   enron   he said   works in both down and  up markets      enron   s earnings are more solid today than they   ve ever been       and  they   re valuable because we   re becoming a digital economy     he said     we  need high   quality power   and local power plants have trouble providing  reliability   enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in  times of stress on the system      of course there   s still the issue about trusting management   after  skilling left   enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief  operating

the work    going             talk to you soon             nick           vince   j   kaminski   enron   com wrote                 nick                 we can close the loop on our commitment to support the research    projects        before your visit to enron                 my assistant   shirley crenshaw   will call you to set up a conference      call        with me   stinson gibner          and tom gros from enron broadband services to discuss all the isssues          friday this week would work for        both tom and me   i think we need about 15 minutes                 vince               p   s   shirley   nick   s phone number is 650 796 8163   cell     650   725   5525          office                   nick bambos on 03   12   2000 05   32   35 pm               to   vince   j   kaminski   enron   com   bambos   stanford   stanford   edu        cc          subject   visit to enron               hello vince                 it was nice seeing you at stanford and many thanks for the lunch        we had together   i really enjoyed our discussions   both at the        technical level and otherwise                 i promised to send you an e   mail regarding possible dates for        a visit to enron   i delayed it for a week till my schedule was        clearer   let   s see if we can get a match with your schedule          mine is rather terrible                 friday   21 st of april looks good   but april 23 rd is easter        sunday   so that may make it difficult for some people at enron        to be around   let me know if that is the case   i am willing to        visit then   because the week after that i am scheduled to be in        japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays                 friday   19 th of may is the next possibility   but this probably        is too far out   the main problem is that i am operating within        a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this        research   this window closes by the end of april   and it would be        important for the student support funds to be in place then   so        that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top        talent   i am already reviewing files of students who have        approached me for phd advising   and i am in a mode of doing   soft        commitments to star   level students   to get this research and its        potential on their radar screen   top students are highly sought        after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this        competition                 does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the        project and student support at stanford   if so   doing it before the        end of april is important for getting top people   if the visit can        happen after we get the ball rolling   then we can schedule it in may          i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets        going   please let me know what you think                 best regards                 nick',\n",

report   07   20   2001    dear all    attached is this week   s legislative report    this entire week has been focused on devising a   solution   for the energy  crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget   although  the democratic leadership of the assembly and the governor successfully  lobbied four assembly republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the  budget on monday   the four republicans have refused to vote for five crucial    trailer   bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill   there are  approximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget  bill   but 5 have raised concerns for the republicans   sb 767 transportation  funding shift   sb 735 elimination of school facility fee housing programs    sb 1041 omnibus health trailer bill   ab 144 public social services and sb  79 omnibus social services trailer bill   senate president pro tempore john  burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the senate  until the trailer bills are approved by the assembly   as of 7   00 p   m    tonight   there is no budget deal    meanwhile   on the energy front   the four proposals we have been discussing  all week     sb 18 xx   burton     sb 78 xx   polanco     ab 82 xx   keeley   and ab  83 xx   wright       are still   in play   legislatively this evening   even though  the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals  are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly  and senate to stay in session   despite the scheduled summer break   until a  bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to  him for signature      sb 78 xx   polanco   electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001  passed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes   the  originally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original  memorandum of understanding     mou     negotiated between governor davis and  southern california edison     edison       it was recently amended to reflect  senator sher   s proposed   plan b   of the mou     a version of the mou opposed  by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy    it was heard in the senate energy   utilities and communications committee on  wednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote   reconsideration was  granted   however   and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2  noes on thursday morning   the authors took up amendments such as striking  the urgency clause   changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws    placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399   26    which insulated edison international from certain claims   during the  thursday hearing   sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations  committee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes      sb 18 xx   burton   department of water resources   electricity   bond  financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2  noes   making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower   cheaper rate  than allotted in ab lx   keeley   assuming the assembly concurs and the bill  is signed by governor davis   the bill also prohibits any additional charges  such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and  requires certain   sunshine   provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts  entered to by the dwr   we understand that j   p   morgan and lehman brothers      the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering      have advised the governor   s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of  the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons   so it is unclear whether  this bill will ever be signed   the bill was heard by the senate energy    utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10  ayes and 0 noes vote   it next must be heard in the assembly      ab 82 xx   keeley   electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001  passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday  evening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote   it was then heard later the same  evening by the assembly appropriations committee   where it was passed on a  11 ayes and 6 noes vote   this is the   compromise   bill we have been  discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred  keeley   the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this  report   with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by  the full assembly   possibly later this evening   the current version of the  bill provides for limited direct access   state purchase of edison   s  transmission lines for   2   4 billion   a minimum 30 percent   haircut   for the  major generators and a   trust   to cover all claims not dealt with by the  haircut option      ab 83 xx   wright   alternative electric utility rate stabilization act  of 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx   by assembly member bill campbell   in the  assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening   and then  passed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes   it next must be heard by  the assembly appropriations committee   barring a rule waiver   no such  committee hearing is scheduled at this time   co   authored by assembly  members rod wright   keith richman   joe canciamilla and bill campbell   the  bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address  the net undercollection   among other things    other energy   related developments this week include      sb 84 xx   burton   state energy resources conservation and development  commission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and  sent to the assembly   this bill provides   10 million from the state general  fund to the california energy commission     cec     to fund a matching grant  program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals   the grant  program will be administered by the cec   in consultation with local  governments   and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup  system   it next must be heard in the assembly      the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board  for an independent slate of directors on wednesday   the ferc announced on  friday   despite a dec 15   2000   ferc order requiring the appointment of an  independent governing board for the iso   the state has refused to follow the  order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of  the board   supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees  should not oversee power markets due to the state   s domineering role in  purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities      sb 85 xx   burton   electrical restructuring   rates passed out of the  full senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes   this bill bars the  california public utilities commission   cpuc   from raising rates back to the  pre   10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate  reduction period has expired on march 31   2002   it next must be heard in  the assembly      the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to  investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company  executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies    trading practices   the resolution     sr 14     passed out with 28 ayes and 6  noes      the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted  unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas   based reliant  energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents    despite reliant   s having handed over 10   000 documents   the committee  rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality  of reliant   s documents   the committee stepped back from its contempt vote  last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to  agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas    mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over  subpoenaed documents   the contempt citation against reliant will be  presented to the full senate   and then immediately sent to the rules  committee for another hearing before the full senate acts   dunn said      the state   s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped  from   8   9 billion to   6   1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment  in the state   s figure on wednesday   although the state continues to argue  that the   8   9 billion figure is correct   ferc judge curtis wagner called the  figure   baseless   and criticized the california delegation for   not  negotiating in good faith   during the recent settlement discussions   the  new amount     6   1 billion   does not include power sales to municipal  utilities and alternative energy suppliers     two entities that do not fall  under the purview of the iso   px or the state dwr     as well as applies ferc  price controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales  from october 2 onward      ab 28 xx   migden   electrical restructuring   oversight board   iso  passed out of the senate energy   utilities and communications committee on  tuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes   it was amended by  the author in committee to   double   join   it to sb 39 xx   see below     this  amendment   ties   the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx   unless  the double   joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the  governor for signature   assuming the bill gets to the governor      sb 39 xx   speier   public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly  energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes    reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to  the author   given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee   ab 28 xx is  effectively   dead   as well for the moment   see discussion of ab 28 xx above      best regards    tom mcmorrow and mike martinez       iepa

            "Subject  thestreet   com   trade winds blowing enron further south  trade winds blowing enron further south  by peter eavis  senior columnist  08   30   2001 02   45 pm edt  url    enron   ene   nyse   news   commentary   appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high   profile energy trading operation    a billion   dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant   s second   quarter profits   which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company   s well   publicized trading acumen   a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second   quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates   one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated   complicating matters   enron   s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings    for its part   enron flatly denies that it used one   time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired   assets sale was inflated   but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston   based enron   which has long told investors that trading is its future   by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation   s fast   growing energy market   enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years   operating earnings from trading surged 160   in 2000 to   1   6 billion   causing the stock to double    now there   s chatter that enron   s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter   s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities   in addition   the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit   if asset sales can   t be repeated and trading income weakens   earnings could crater   observers say   which could pull enron   s already battered stock down even lower    in fact   fear that enron   s prodigious profits growth won   t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year   other factors have contributed as well   investor dissatisfaction over enron   s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year   and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job   skilling   s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move    enron chairman ken lay   who has now reassumed the ceo post   said this week that he aims to improve enron   s disclosure   he has moved to allay concerns over top   level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president   also vacated by skilling   and vice chairman    but skeptics remain unconvinced     i think the second   quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales     says mark roberts   director of research at off wall street   a cambridge   mass     based stock analysis firm that doesn   t do underwriting     off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may     for the quarter   enron made 45 cents a share   3 cents more than analysts had expected    details   details  one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas   fired power plants to allegheny energy supply   a unit of allegheny energy   aye   nyse   news   commentary     hagerstown   md   the deal took place in may for a price of   1   05 billion   according to allegheny   s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures     allegheny declined to comment on the deal      enron   s second   quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so   called peaker plants   says roberts   he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as   500 million   an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to   300 million     his firm hasn   t done recent underwriting for enron      enron   s financial statements don   t specify the size of the gain from the peakers   so called because they supply power when demand is strong   the company declines to offer a number   saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold    however   enron   s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales   and   services line   which is by far the biggest contributor to enron   s earnings   producing   762 million in operating profits in the second quarter    the problem is that the firm   s trading profits also are booked in this segment   as a result   investors can   t know how much of the quarter   s blowout commodity sales   and   services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading   if roberts     500 million estimate is correct   trading may have accounted for only   262 million in second   quarter operating profit    partners indeed  the other deal that   s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas   based assets that are used to produce mtbe   methyl tertiary   butyl ether     the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently    the assets were sold for   120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary   called eott energy partners   eot   nyse   news   commentary     chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil   any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron   s wholesale line    the issues with the deal are plenty   it took place on june 30   right at the end of the second quarter   this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second   quarter results    then there   s the question of price   enron took a   440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999   responding to what it described at the time as   significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe     some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels    skeptics ask   how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for   120 million    in addition   an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they   re worth   50 million at most   he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around   150 million    put bluntly   did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations    an enron spokeswoman responds     eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business   it makes good business sense      and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott   s audit committee   made up of three directors who aren   t employees or officers of any enron affiliate   as well as an investment bank   judged the sale price to be fair   however   the chairman of the audit committee   daniel whitty   is a director for two other enron subsidiaries   he declined to comment on the deal    a person familiar with enron   s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third   quarter numbers    this person also says the gain was   immaterial   to enron   s second   quarter numbers   since there wasn   t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold   most important   this person insists   the   120 million price isn   t based only on the assets sold   eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years   worth of mtbe   related business   what   s more   enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production   this person states    whatever the case with the mtbe assets   enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay   s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset   sale gains     they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is     concludes off wall street   s roberts    know any companies that the market may be misvaluing   detox would like to hear about them   please send all feedback to peavis   thestreet   com    in keeping with tsc   s editorial policy   peter eavis doesn

ect   ect  subject   re   approval procedure for pending products    we are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products   the scheduled process will therefore re   create these products every day automatically   essentially just a change to the description     therefore the product will already be there   in the mean time   all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue   we currently have most desks creating products weeks   months in advance   this software change is scheduled for friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month   february      we have only 2 logged   taped phone calls to the helpdesk when portland office has called the helpdesk with regard to this issue   clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap   but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo   dale does come in early specifically for any products portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times   bad traffic   when he may be late    14   1 07   35   cst   j richter called to approve products  products activated products within 2 minutes    24   1 07   34   cst   j richter called to approve products  07   45   cst   anna gardiner approved products  07   46   cst   j richter called to inquire on status  07   48   cst   helpdesk rang j richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems  clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but enrononline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone   we only seem to have 2 times that the procedure has been used to the helpdesk extent and not failed dramatically    changing the procedure for two days   assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods   when we are all working to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems   if we do not introduce this software change on friday we should review this policy   i obviously have no problem with tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway       michael etringer       01   26   2000 04   47 pm     to   louise kitchen   lon   ect   ect  cc   tim belden   hou   ect   ect   chris h foster   hou   ect   ect   dale neuner   hou   ect   ect  subject   approval procedure for pending products  i would like to talk with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products   it is not working   the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there   if dale is not in the office   or it is before or after normal work hours   the traders need to call the help desk   who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product   the portland office starts trading at 5   00 am ppt   in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning   this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval   it took 45 minutes to get those products approved   on daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour   as a result   the trader missed most of the trading period   our customers are not happy and neither are the traders    a solution was proposed in december   which i have attached below   to address this issue   however   it only works in the ideal world   it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time   that is not the reality   by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade    i would like to propose an alternate solution   we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products   these are not new products   we trade them every day   there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to   at the very least approve existing products   especially where the only change is the term    please call tim belden at 503   464   3820 or myself at 503   464   3836   look forward to hearing from you    regards    mike etringer  503   464

 product activation for portland power  mike    regarding our conversation re   support of power trading   we propose the following    1   suggest to trading that they create all draft products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day   i will always check for draft products at the end of my day and activate any that are in draft   just fyi   gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days   or weeks   in advance   i keep track of those and keep their products current in advance   it works very well    2   i am usually at my desk no later than 7   30 a   m   each day   if trading creates a draft product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the call center at 3   4357 and state the following    this is portland power trading and i need a product activated asap   please contact amita gosalia in london    the call center will then contact amita   who has the authority and responsibility for activating products   amita has agreed to perform this function for portland power and will instruct her people at pcg   london to locate her immediately   in the event that she is away from her desk   when this message comes in from the call center    donna greif in the call center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible call center personnel    i hope this solves the problem   please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear    dale\n",

for your message   i had you on my   to do   list today to  follow   up from our conversation last week   i appreciate your responses   and  will follow   up as needed    just to recap eim   s current inititives       pwc   was engaged in 10   00 to develop a business plan  for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical  business   in 11   00   aa was engaged to develop a   blueprint   of eim major  processes   deal execution   deal capture   risk management   logistics    settlements and financial reporting     down to level 2 processes   the  initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the    blueprint     a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and  recommended systems   a complete   roadmap   should be laid out with a  0   3 months   4   6 months   7   9 months and 10   12 months timeline   the plan  addresses tactical also    our overall objective   build an infrastructure   people   processes and  systems   that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim   the  current industries are forest products and steel   however   additional  industries may be added   the targeted infrastructure would require little  change to support new industries    the delieverable is expected by the end of 2   01   we   d be happy to visit with  you all   video conference or houston             to give you more information   let  me know how to proceed    thanks again for your time   since i wasn   t able to attend the controllers    conference last 10   00   i   m glad i got to meet you last week   stay in touch    brenda  to   brenda f herod   hou   ect   ect  cc   mike jordan   lon   ect   ect   paul wallace   lon   ect   ect  subject   metals  brenda  as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality  between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals    in particular i promised info on a few areas    project q assessment  a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals    being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem   however high level issues  which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were    q is over specified for metals   traffic   logistics for metals is less  complex than oil   coal    metals process tends towards buy   store   sell whereas for liquids the storage  is not as prevelant  metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship   barge  2   inventory controls  again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals   paul  wallace a manager in the co   ordination function is working extensively on  developing the controls in this area   i would suggest that you contact paul  directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in  general    3   funding of inventory  we have a structured finance facility here in london   the deal is specific to  enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are  the base index for all the positions placed in the facility   if structured  financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either  david tregar   metals commercial   or bill appleby   global finance   as an intro  to the issues faced    4   curve management process  the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme  curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and  location   given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by  brand group and port location   e   g   for copper this means we have a grid with  5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups   13 for europe   7 for the us and 6  for the far east     the maintaince   price testing of the grids is made  manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port  groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points  i   e   price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a  market quote    5   re recruitment of paper traders  i haven   t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david  rosenblum   one of the metals traders in chicago   is a trader of recylced  paper    i   ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london    i   d appreciate same for eim    regards  andy\n",
